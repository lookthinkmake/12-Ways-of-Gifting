#12 Ways of Gifting

Built from [Hossein Karami's](https://github.com/HosseinKarami) [FastShell](https://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell),
this project uses [HTML5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Sass](http://gulpjs.com/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), and [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/).

To install dependencies, run `npm install` in the root directory.

After node packages finish installation, run `gulp` to start server, and watch for changes.

Working files are kept in the `src` directory, and minified into production files found in the `app` directory.

##Usage
For watching and compiling (Sass, Server on 127.0.0.1:9000 with LiveReload) simply run the default gulp command:

```
$ gulp
```
